# web-crawler-gpu
Experimentally Web Crawler using GPU (CUDA + PyTorch + BERT)

This project is still in alpha stage.
It crawls the sites asynchronously and gathers the essential tokens (keywords) and stores it in a CSV.

Tested to work on Ubuntu 20.04 with NVIDIA's CUDA 11.4. 
Created mostly with the help of ChatGPT (GPT-4) but with several hours of work in improving and taking bugs out.
